Eiffel is the most complete object-oriented language around. 
It is a simple complex language. Isn’t that an oxymoron? 
Yes, but in Eiffel’s case the simplicity of learning the language 
itself might conclude some to believe it is only a basic language, 
or as some would disparagingly say a teaching language. 
This is far from the truth, since Eiffel supports the most sophisticated 
software development methods. 
It is a complete philosophy of programming - 
that philosophy getting out of the way so that you can program. 
It minimizes the importance of things that are not so important in software development 
and put the things that are important at the top in other words everything is put in 
its place other languages are just used for coding.
